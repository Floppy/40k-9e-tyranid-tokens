# Tokens

`tokens.svg` and `tokens.pdf` contain a set of tokens for all the command phase buffs, psychic powers,
and infection tokens for the Parasite of Mortrex. They're designed to be printed on
paper, cut out, and stuck onto a 32mm base.

You'll probably get the best print results from the SVG file, but if the font (Futura) doesn't look 
right and the text is too large, try the PDF instead.

# Synaptic Imperative cards

Rather than tokens, Synaptic Imperatives are cards, created using [MTG.Design](https://mtg.design/u/Floppy9950/TYR), 
a great card designer for Magic: The Gathering.
